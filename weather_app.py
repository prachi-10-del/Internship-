10_weather_solution.py - Day 12 exercise: INSTRUCTOR SOLUTION

TEACHES : The full pattern - user input, a cached API call with complete
          error handling, and three metric cards. The shape of every
          data-fetching app: input -> API call -> display.
SLIDE   : Day 12, Slide 14 - Solution Walkthrough (deck page 14/16)
          Reveal after students have tried file 09.
RUN     : streamlit run 10_weather_solution.py

EXPECTED OUTPUT IN THE BROWSER
    A city dropdown over three cards - Temperature, Wind Speed, Humidity -
    filled with live values for the chosen city, and a caption showing
    the reading's timestamp.
    Switch city and all three update. Switch back within 10 minutes and
    they come from the cache, with no API call at all.

REQUIRES
    pip install requests streamlit
    An internet connection. Open-Meteo needs no API key.
